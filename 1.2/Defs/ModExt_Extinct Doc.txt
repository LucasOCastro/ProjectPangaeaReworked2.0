This modExtension should be applied to the ThingDef of a pawn or plant. It makes it not spawn as normal, ensures it has an assigned DNA and a fossil.

Nodes for the ModExt_Extinct extension:
<genus> and <species> are used to generate the scientific name of the pawn/plant.
<scientificName> can also be used to ovewrite the "{Genus} {species}" scheme.
<animalType> is mainly used to generate the texture path of the DNA and the item category. It has these values:
{
	Unspecified,
	Mammal,
	Dinosaur,
	Reptile,
	Bird,
	Synapsid,
	Amphibian,
	Invertebrate,
	Fish
}
<fossilTexturePath> is quite obvious :)
